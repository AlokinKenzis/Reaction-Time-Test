# Reaction-Time-Test
Simple desc: A reaction time test. Click your mouse anywhere on the screen when the window turns green similar to Human Benchmark, it will 
show the time delay in miliseconds after you clicked ðŸ˜Š I Recommend playing some music in the background.

Detailed description: The time in ms is rounded to 10, for example if your response time is 151ms, it will get rounded to 160ms
                      Press F1 if you wan't to exit the app
                      There is an X on the top right so you may quit the program that way too.
                      This is used as a warmup before you play any game that needs quick reactions.
                      Average reaction time is about 200ms, but that's with people that play on 60hz and on the browser that is affected by DWM's latency.
                      So it's probably averaged more so at the 170-180ms and not 200ms.

                      Fsm reason Cynet and Zillya are false positives, everything else show's that it is fine.
